     <p>
             I was born and raised in Amarillo, Texas.
         <br>I've worked in roofing, carpet installation, and construction.
         <br> My hobbies include 3d modeling and animation, reading, and creating games.
         <br>Some of my favorite authors include Terry Brooks, Hugh Cook, and Stephen King.
         <br>And the silhouette to the left looks absolutely nothing like me.
